As such you mush use the correct\r\nversion of ICJI for the version of IBM Cognos you have.  Below is a reference \r\nfor version capatability.\r\n\r\nICJI Version\t\tIBM Cognos Version\r\n\r\n\t1.0.0 ............................ 8.4.1\r\n\r\n\t1.1.0 ................... Not Yet Tested\r\n\r\n\t1.2.0 ........................... 10.1.1\r\n\r\n\t1.3.0 ............................. 10.2\r\n\r\n\r\n###Quick Start:\r\n\r\n[Download the ICJI repository](https://github.com/addoholdings/icji/downloads) \r\nand save the .zip or .tar.gz file. Decompress the \r\nfile and you will see two directories along with other files and directories. \r\nThese two are the only directories that you need to be concerned with.\r\n\r\nMove or Save the \"js\" and \"css\" directories into the \"webcontent\" directory \r\non the Cognos Gateway server. I usually put then in a new directory under \r\nthe skins directory in webcontent. \r\nexample. install_dir/webcontent/skins/icji\r\n\r\nIf your environment has more than one Gateway server, the files have to be on \r\nall Gateways, in the same directory.\r\n\r\nAfter the files are on the Gateway(s) you're ready to build a report with the \r\ncode. Open a Report Studio report and add the following code to an HTML Item \r\nat the top of the Prompt Page or Report Page you want to modify.\r\n\r\n```html\r\n<script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"/ibmcognos/...storage_directory/jquery-1.7.1.min.js\"></script>\r\n<script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"/ibmcognos/...storage_directory/log4javascript.js\"></script>\r\n<script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"/ibmcognos/...storage_directory/icji-1.1.0.min.js\"></script>\r\n\r\n<script>\r\n  var $icji = jQuery.noConflict(true);\r\n  var log = log4javascript.getDefaultLogger();\r\n  log.setLevel(log4javascript.Level.ALL);\r\n  log4javascript.setEnabled(false);  // This turns off logging. If you want logging to run, comment this line.\r\n  log.trace(\"This is a debugging message from the log4javascript in-page page\");\r\n</script>\r\n```\r\n\r\nThat's it, you're ready to start coding...\r\n\r\n\r\n###Samples:\r\n\r\nAt some point in the near future I'll build some samples. But, right now I \r\nhaven't told anyone this is available so I'm assuming no one except me \r\nneeds to know how to use it... :)\r\n\r\n\r\n###Overview and History:\r\n\r\nThis .js is intended to provide some basic JavaScript functions for use in \r\nIBM Cognos HTML based reports. When Cognos (not owned by IBM at the time) came \r\nout with ReportNet it geared the report building toward browser base delivery\r\nof reports. As part of that push to deliver HTML reports, a feature was add \r\ncalled the \"HTML Item.\" This feature provided a way to embed HTML directly into\r\nthe Report that was generate allowing the developer to access and modify the \r\ngenerated report after it was delivered to the browser. This of course included\r\nembedded JavaScript code.\r\n\r\nOne of the primary uses we developers used this new feature for was to \r\nsupplement the capabilities of the out-of-the-box Cognos Report Studio. Things\r\nthat we thought should have been available were not. Things like setting the \r\ndefault search options for a Search and Select prompt - not available... \r\nHowever embedding some JavaScript into the report via an HTML Item allowed \r\nfor modifying the report after the page loaded. \r\n\r\nThe primary object that has been used to this point to access the Cognos objects\r\nin the browser up to this point has been the infamous \"formWarpRequest\". This \r\nform element contained all the elements that up would normally want to access. \r\nHowever Cognos has a tendency to change the function of some of the object and \r\nsometimes removes functionality altogether. For those of us that have been \r\naround long enough, to experience the pain of upgrading a boat load of reports \r\nthat need to have there embedded and heavily duplicated JavaScript fixed \r\nas a result of these changes, it's easy to understand why you would want a way \r\nto isolate those potential problem.\r\n\r\nAs a consultant, I've spent many hours at dozens of client sights being paid \r\nto do nothing but fix broken JavaScript code during system upgraded. Thus was \r\nthe birth of ICJI. It started out about 4 years ago as a hodge podge of code \r\nfrom dozens of experiences all in random .js files. As the years progressed \r\nand my understanding of JavaScript deepened it morphed in to what it is today.\r\nNow, it's grown to the point that I feel it's time to start officially \r\ntracking the changes I'm making. Because this code, in one name or another, \r\nhas been used at so many client sites, there will come a time when they'll \r\nneed to upgrade it to some new version of Cognos. When that time comes I want\r\nto be able to make good on my promise of making their upgrade as seamless as\r\npossible. ...at least from the perspective of the code I've written for them. \r\nI make no promises for other peoples code! :)\r\n\r\n###[Issues:](https://github.com/addoholdings/icji/issues) \r\nWhen you find an issue or you have a problem with the code or you'd like to request \r\nand enhancement to the code, you are more that welcome to use the \r\n[issues tool](https://github.com/addoholdings/icji/issues) that GitHub provides.\r\n\r\nAs a consultant I always assume that the code I write will eventually be modified, \r\nupdated, etc. If you are using this code and have questions, have \r\na more efficient way to do something, etc. and are feeling generous, let me \r\nknow your thoughts: chris.bennett@addoholdings.com or contact me through \r\nmy GitHub account:  https://github.com/addoholdings\r\n\r\n###About Me:\r\n\r\nI've been a Cognos consultant since 1999. I've done just about everything I can\r\nthink of related to Cognos BI and related technologies - DB Architecture, ETL, \r\nCognos Admin, Modeling, Development, web/web services development.  \r\n\r\nThanks!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
